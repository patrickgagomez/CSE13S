# Assignment 6 - C++ Big Integer Calculator

The sixth assignment in CSE101 which explores creating a Big Integer Calculator!

## Building

make  (will make all the necessary files for running and executables)

make Arithmetic (will make the main Arithmetic.cpp file and necessary executables)

make BigIntegerClient (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for BigInteger.cpp(.h))

make ListClient (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for List.cpp(.h))

make clean (will remove all necessary files that were created)

make format (will format all working files)

## Running

$ make

$ ./Arithmetic (< input file >) (< output file>)

$ make clean

## Notes
For some reason the tests that run in the grading script get all wonky with zeros. I have used up all of my time however. You can see if you run BigIntegerClient (the test file) that everything was working as intended! I'm not sure why that was happening!!!
