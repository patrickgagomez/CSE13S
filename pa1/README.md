# Assignment 1 - Lists 

The first assignment in CSE101 which explores using a Doubly Linked List to create a List.

## Building

make  (will make all the necessary files for running and executables)

make ListTest (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for List.c(.h))

make all (will make all executable programs)

make clean (will remove all necessary files for running INCLUDING files made by keygen ('rsa.pub', 'rsa.priv'))

make format (will format all working files)

## Running

$ make
$ ./Lex <\input file> <\outputfile>

## Notes
No special notes! Valgrind runs without leaks and code is functional!
