# Assignment 3 - Graphs and Strongly Connected Components (DFS)

The third assignment in CSE101 which explores using an array of Doubly Linked Lists to create a functioning Graph ADT, then using the DFS algorithm finds the Strongly Connected Components of the Graph.

## Building

make  (will make all the necessary files for running and executables)

make GraphTest (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for Graph.c(.h))

make all (will make all executable programs)

make clean (will remove all necessary files for running INCLUDING files made by keygen ('rsa.pub', 'rsa.priv'))

make format (will format all working files)

## Running

$ make
$ ./FindComponents <\input file> <\outputfile>

## Notes
No special notes! Valgrind runs with one leak that I can't find and the code is functional!
