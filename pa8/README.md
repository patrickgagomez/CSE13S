# Assignment 8 - C++ Dictionary (BST-RBT)

The seventh assignment in CSE101 which explores creating a Dictionary using a Red-Black Balanced Binary Search Tree!

## Building

make  (will make all the necessary files for running and executables)

make Order (will make the main Order.cpp file and necessary executables)

make WordFrequency (will make the main WordFrequency.cpp file and necessary executables)

make DictionaryTest (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for DictionaryTest.cpp)

make clean (will remove all necessary files that were created)

make format (will format all working files)

## Running

$ make

$ ./Order (< input file >) (< output file>)
$ ./WordFrequency (< input file >) (< output file>)

$ make clean

## Notes
Everything working except WordFrequency! I think I'm not using the delimiter correctly but I can't seem to fix it.
