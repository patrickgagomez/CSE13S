# Assignment 4 - Matrix Calculator

The fourth assignment in CSE101 which explores using a List ADT to create and calculate a Matrix.

## Building

make  (will make all the necessary files for running and executables)

make GraphTest (will make all necessary files for a main testing function for Graph.c(.h))

make all (will make all executable programs)

make clean (will remove all necessary files for running INCLUDING files made by keygen ('rsa.pub', 'rsa.priv'))

make format (will format all working files)

## Running

$ make

$ ./Sparse <\input file> <\outputfile>

## Notes
My functionality is almost completely working, however some of the Sparce tests do not pass! Despite memory leaks, the program still passes most grading script standards.
